// Package aeimagesflags lets you use the undocumented flags of the
// App Engine Images service URLs to serve transformed images.
//
// Most of the flags are extracted from the answer to this question:
//     http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25148567/list-of-all-the-app-engine-images-service-get-serving-url-uri-options
//
// As mentioned there these flags are not documented; Google could remove most of them without notice at any time.
